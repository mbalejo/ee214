% Given that x contain normally distributed numbers and y with uniformly
% distributed numbers, it is expected that their scatter plot linearly or
% vertically moves closer to x=0 and instead of a circular-shaped
% scatterplot. Figure 1 proves this statement with x having a bell-shaped
% histogram with most of the samples are scattered at the mean '0' while
% y having samples distributed between 0 and 1.
%
% Figure 2 on the other hand shows the joint histogram of x and y with its
% x-axis represent the histogram of x and the y-axis represent the
% histogram of y. The top-view of Figure 2 show the equivalent plot of the
% shown scatterplot in Figure 1. Hence, the joint histogram in Figure 2 is
% consistent with the scatterplot in Figure 1.
%
% Note: scatterplot and its variant functions of MATLAB returns the 
% marginal distribution of x,y.

% Figures 3 and 4 show the histogram of the selected samples given y0=0.5
% and a tolerance of 0.1 for P(x|y). The histogram or the marginal
% distribution of x in figures 3 and 4 differs from marginal distribution
% of x in figures 1 and 2 in a way that the number of samples are trimmed
% between the threshold of y>0.4 and y<0.6. Generally, the historgram or
% marginal distribution of both are still the same in terms of the
% distribution shape of both x, y, and the scatterplot (top-view).

% This condition is possible when there are elements equal to 0.5
% in array y. If this happens, only the samples that suffice the condition
% y==0.5 will be generated and plotted. The x and y curves will still be
% the same only that the samples plotted in the curve are those that
% suffices the given condition (similar to above plots but with fewer
% samples or bars).

% P.S. this condition rarely happen to randomly generated numbers, hehe.

% Figure 8 shows the histogram of BPSYS.txt population sampled by n=20. It
% yields a mean of 128.90 and standard deviation of 25.7966. The plot is

% distributed normally or uniformly. The yielded mean represent the highest
% peak of the generated sample which is within the bar sample of 120-140 
% with a std of ~30.

% Given the above results of section II - central limit theorem, the mean
% and standard deviation of the sampled BPSYS.txt by n for N-times are
% expected. The mean specifies the center of the largest sample while the
% standard deviation shows the step from the centroid of the sample bar to
% another. If the mean and std are in float value, the graph represent it
% by its round-off integer value. Nevertheless, the same values are
% ofcourse expected. Also, changing the values of n and N alter the values
% of mean and std which affect the histogram and the representation of the
% mean and std graphically. By technical observation, the samples are
% normally distributed.

%% Conclusion:
% This exercise allowed me to explore joint probability and central limit
% theorem on application basis through MATLAB. In joint probability, I
% realized that given a random variable defined in a probability space, a
% general probability distribution indicates the chnace that each sample
% will fall within a [articular range or set of individual values specified
% for a variable. In central limit theorem, it states that there is a
% population with mean mu and stadard deviation sigma, and given these
% parameters the distribution becomes equivalently normal.
