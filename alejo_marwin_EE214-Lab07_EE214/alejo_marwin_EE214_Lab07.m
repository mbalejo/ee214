% *I. Sunspot Activity Analysis*
sunspot_demo

%%
% *a. Study the code and the comments in the code give your insights on how 
% the spectral analysis was done, how was the cycle period computed?* 

%%
% Based on the given MATLAB code, the sunspot cycle period was computed
% using periodogram through *Fourier transform* or *FFT*. Fourier transform 
% is not only useful in solving partial differential equations but in data 
% analysis of time series data as well. Periodogram on the other hand
% allows the identification of dominant frequencies or cyclical behavior of
% a time series data, particularly when cycles happened under an unusual
% or longer redundant timeframe.

%%
% *b. Write your own MATLAB code using |periodogram()| to estimate the
% sunspot activity cycle.*

%%
% Using *periodogram()* 
load sunspot.dat
year=sunspot(:,1); 
data=sunspot(:,2);
data=detrend(data);
figure;
subplot(2,1,1), plot(year,data)
title('Sunspot Data')
nfft=length(data);
[Pxx,f] = periodogram(data, [], nfft, 1);
nn=2:length(f);
subplot(2,1,2), semilogx(1./f(nn), Pxx(nn))
xlabel('years/cycle')

%%
% Using *FFT* for checking of the above results.
load sunspot.dat
year=sunspot(:,1);
relNums=sunspot(:,2);
figure; subplot(2,1,1); plot(year,relNums)
title('Sunspot Data')
Y = fft(relNums);
Y(1)=[];
n=length(Y);
power = abs(Y(1:floor(n/2))).^2;
nyquist = 1/2;
freq = (1:n/2)/(n/2)*nyquist;
period=1./freq;
subplot(2,1,2); plot(period,power);
axis([0 40 0 2e+7]);
ylabel('Power');
xlabel('Period (Years/Cycle)');
hold on;
index=find(power==max(power));
mainPeriodStr=num2str(period(index));
plot(period(index),power(index),'r.', 'MarkerSize',25);
text(period(index)+2,power(index),['Period = ',mainPeriodStr]);
hold off;

%%
% *Observation:* 
% As shown above, the first code snippet through the periodogram function
% shows that the sunspot occurs every 11 years. The second code snippet
% using FFT function only proves that the generate result of the first
% snippet are correct. Both of these functions allow to generate the PDS of
% any time series data except that the later method ( |pediogram()| )
% require only direct vector input of the detrended observed data while |fft()|
% require the recomputations of the observed data frequency to cyclic
% period.

%%
% *Discussion:* The power spectral density (PSD) of a WSS random process
% X(t) is given by the Fourier transform of its autocorrelation function 
% $S_x(f)=\int_{-\infty }^{\infty}R_X(\tau)e^{-j2\pi f \tau} d\tau$ 

%%
% For a discrete-time process $X_n$, the psd is given by the discrete-time
% Fourier transform (DTFT) of its autocorrelation sequence 
% $S_x(f)=\sum_{n=-\infty }^{\infty }R_x(n)e^{-j2\pi fn},\frac{-1}{2}\leq f \leq \frac{1}{2}$

%%
% Since the DTFT is periodic in $f$ with period 1, we only need to consider
% $\left | f \right | \leq \frac{1}{2}$

%%
% $R_x(\tau) (R_x(n))$ can be recovered from $S_x(f)$ by taking the inverse
% Fourier Transform $R_X(\tau)=\int_{-\infty }^{\infty }S_X(f)e^{j2\pi f \tau}df, R_X(n)=\int_{\frac{-1}{2}}^{\frac{1}{2}}S_X(f)e^{j2\pi fn}df$


%%
% *II. Noise and LTI Systems*

%%
% *a. We have shown previously that the process is stationary and ergodic
% but non-correlated, we will not pass this process to a LTI system, a
% simple low pass filter.* 
x = randn(1000,1); %generate 1000point gaussian dist
w = conv(x,ones(1,4)/4,'same'); %smoothening filter with mentioned IR in the manual
figure; plot(x); hold on; plot(w,'r'); hold off; 
title('Generated process(blue) vs Smoothened/Filtered process(red)');
figure; plot(xcorr(w,'biased')); title('PSD of w');

%%
% *Observation:* |randn()| allows the generation of gaussian process of length
% 1000. The |conv()| function allows the application of a simple LP filter to
% smoothen the generated gaussian process by [0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25] as given
% in the manual. As shown in the figure, the filtered signal (red) has
% smoother time variations when autocorrelation was introduced by the
% simple LPF.

%%
% *b. Predict the resulting autocorrelation of the output process y(t). Is the
% output still ergodic? Is it WSS? Explain your answer.* 

%%
% In theory, the filtered gaussian process is *WSS* since its mean is
% approximately similar to the mean of the original gaussian process;
% consider |mean(x,1)| and |mean(w,1)| . Moreover, the filtered gaussian
% process is surely *ergodic* given the fact that there is only one function
% process exsiting in the time space.'

%%
% *c. To verify the properties of the output process y(t), implement the
% resulting filter with x(t) s input using the matlab command:
% |y = filter([0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25], 1, x);| where x is a vector containing 
% a sample function of the process x(t). Estimate the autocorrelation 
% $Ry(\tau)$ using |xcorr()| , i.e. |ry = xcorr(y, biasedâ€™)| .
% Does the output autocorrelation agree with theory?*

y = filter(ones(1,4)/4, 1, x);
figure; plot(xcorr(w,'biased')); title('PSD of y');

%%
% Based on the generated results, the experimental outcome of 1.c agreed
% with the theoretical outcome of 1.b.

%%
% *d. Let s use another filter defined by the following equation 
% |y(t) = 0.9y(t-1) + 0.2x(t)| Suppose we x(t) as input to this filter and 
% predict the autocorrelation of the output process. Is the output still 
% ergodic? Is it WSS? Justify your answer.* 

z = conv(0.2.*x,[1 -0.9],'same'); %smoothening filter with mentioned IR in the manual
figure; plot(x); hold on; plot(z,'r'); hold off; 
title('Generated process(blue) vs Smoothened/Filtered process(red)');
figure; plot(xcorr(z,'biased')); title('PSD of z');

%%
% In theory, given the IR |[1 -0.9]|, the filtered gaussian process 'x' is
% surely an ergodic process given the fact that there is only one process
% in the time space but it is not WSS given the fact that the mean of the
% filtered gaussian process is not the same as with the mean of the
% original gaussian process.

%%
% *e. To compute the output of the above filter in Matlab, we have:
% |y = filter(0.2, [1 -0.9], x);| 
% where x is a vector containing a sample function of the process x(t).
% Estimate the autocorrelation $Ry(\tau)$ using |xcorr()| , i.e. |ry = xcorr(y, 'biased')| .
% Plot and examine Ry(\tau)$ for $-50 \leq \tau \leq 50$. 
% Does it agree with the theory?* 

y2 = filter(0.2, [1 -0.9], x);
cor = xcorr(y2,'biased');
figure; plot(cor(950:1050)); title('PSD of y2(-50:50)');

%%
% Given the results and the experimental results in 1.e does not suffice or
% agreed with those of in 1.d.

%% II. Spectral Analysis of Signals with Noise
%

%%
% *1. Start with the signal with 0 dB noise level and sampling rate at 44100, 
% perform spectral analysis using periodogram. What parameters of the 
% periodogram did you specify (number of FFT points? averaging? one-sided?, 
% ect)?* 
clear;clc;
load('signalA_0dB_44100_5Ts.mat')
data = ytn;
data=detrend(data);
figure; plot(data); title('Fig.2-1. signalA\_0dB\_22000\_5Ts.mat');
title('sigaA\_0db\_44100\_5Ts.mat');
nfft=length(data);
[Pxx,f] = periodogram(data, hamming(nfft), nfft, 44100);
nn=2:length(f);
figure; semilogx(1./f(nn), Pxx(nn)); title('Fig.2-2. periodogram of signalA\_0dB\_44100\_5Ts.mat');

%%
% *a. Briefly justify the parameters you have chosen for the periodogram.*

%%
% This experiment uses the |periodogram()| function of MATLAB to easily
% perform the spectral analysis. By default, this function uses the Hamming
% windowing function due to its accurate effect of the spectrum of the
% signal. Assuming that all discrete points of the signal is affected by 
% the noise (although 0db at this sample), this experiment considered using the 
% same length of the signal as the number of FFT points leading to 
% suppressing the noise. Furthermore, detrending was performed (although 
% not everytime) to ensure that the spectral analysis is focused on the 
% hidden signal of the given process. The Fs input is equivalent to the FS
% values indicated in the table of the manual, which is 44100 in this case.

%%
% *b. Were you able to determine the frequencies of the signals buried in
% noise? What are those frequencies and relative amplitudes?* 

%%
% Using the code snippet in 1., it is evident that this experiment was able 
% to determine the frequency and relative information of the signal which 
% are shown in figure 2-2.

%%
% *2. Repeat your spectral analysis the same signal with 0 dB but with a 
% different sampling rate and perform spectral analysis.*

nn=2:length(f);
figure; semilogx(1./f(nn), Pxx(nn)); title('Fig.2-4. periodogram of signalA\_0dB\_22000\_5Ts.mat');

%%
% *a. What parameters did you use? Are the signal frequencies still 
% discernible?* 

%%
% Using the same the parameters used in 1.a-b of this section (II) such as
% the length of the used process and the defined Fs of it in the manual,
% the smoothened signal is discernable after undergoing detrending and the
% FFT function of the |periodogram()| function although it is not finer as those in figure 2-2. 
% Note that hamming windowing function is used on the process of estimating the PSD of the used signal
% to accurately analyze the spectrum of the signal. Figure 2-4 shows the
% periodogram of the signal with 22000 Fs.

%%
% *b. What is the effect of a lower sampling rate on the spectral analysis?* 

%%
% In theory, lower sampling rate might yield or contribute to the
% probability of having an aliased signal or a signal that was improperly
% sampled which might affect in estimating the PSD of the signal. Hence,
% spikes of noise might be present on the PSD estimate of the signal when
% it's Fs is lower or improper for its spectrum.

%%
% *3. Repeat the process of doing the spectral analysis on the other signals with
% lower (more negative) SNR and at different sampling rates.* 

%%
% *a. Can you still determine the signal frequencies and relative amplitudes
% at -5 dB? at -10 dB*

%%
% *a. Can you still determine the signal frequencies and relative amplitudes 
% at -5 dB? at -10 dB?* 

%%
% Given the results above using the provided signals on selected
% configurations, the frequencies and other information for signals whose
% Fs is 44100 regardless of the noise level are still discernible while
% those signals with 22000 Fs and with -5|-10dB noise are no longer
% discernible. These results subtlely prove the theory in 2.b of this
% section (II) that signals immersed with noise but are sampled lower than
% the requirement of its spectrum affect the estimation of its PSD. Thus,
% for outputs as shown in figures 2-10 and 2-12, the actual PSD were
% overridden by noise while the outputs as shown in figures 2-6 and 2-8
% although few spikes of noise are tolerable and does not completely affect
% the actual power of the signal.

%%
% *b. What is the effect of increasing noise level and sampling rate on the
% ability to discern signal frequencies?* 

%%
% As mentioned in 3.a of this section (II), aside from *aliased signal* ,
% it misleads the actual PSD estimation of the signal by overiding the actual information _(see figures 2-10 and
% 2-12)_.

%%
% *4. Assuming we do not have enough data record about the signal due to a shorter
% observation period, we can simulate this by truncating part of the signal and
% analysing the rest.* 

%%
% *a. For the signals at -5 dB noise level, at sampling rate of 44100, truncate
% the signal and retain only 80% of its original length, or set the values
% of the signals to zero on the truncated part. Perform spectral analysis
% on the truncated signal. Can you still discern the signal frequencies and
% relative amplitudes?*
